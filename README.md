# RT-DETR-Nodule
The main problem solved by this model is how to use a new deep learning method, RT-DETR-Nodule, to improve the detection accuracy and robustness of small lung nodules with irregular shape in CT images.
The study specifically aims to address the challenges posed by small object scale, sample sparsity, and background complexity in CT images, all of which impact the early detection of lung cancer.
